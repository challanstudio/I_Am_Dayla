### 🤔 What is a inhouse designer?
```
It is who make contents only for their company.  
I usually make PR videos, Graphic Design, WEB assets and manage the company's web site.

### 🤔 Why do you study Fontend?
```
Before I became a inhouse designer, I interested in WEB design.  
But it was quite hard to get class of it in Japan, in online or not, both were too expensive to me.
And then I've got a chance that I was in a position to manage all of web assets of us.  
So I suggest the authority to redesign our company's web site. Because it didn't make use of WEB browser.
so that I studied WEB by myself and found some good online classes.  

And it make me so fun! I always made some vidoes and photo, assets for just 'show' to customers,  
but the web, expecially Javascript is not just 'show' somethine, it gives 'experiences' to them.
I love it and I dreamed I wanna make some web game whatn children and adults can enjoy together.
I always imagine parents and children are play together.
